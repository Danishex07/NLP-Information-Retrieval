# NLP-Information-Retrieval

## Overview:
This project focuses on developing a comprehensive toolkit for natural language processing tasks such as information retrieval, clustering, and summarization tool for Jewellery reviews. The tasks include dataset pre-processing, Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), neural information retrieval, clustering, and summarization of search results. Each task is outlined with specific objectives and marks allocation.

## 1. Datasets:
- Download the Jewellery datasets provided in the Coursework folder on the moduleâ€™s Learn Page.
- Set up the data-path in your Google Drive: "/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/COP509cw/Datasets/"
- Add the files to your Datasets folder.

## 2. Task Descriptions:
1. **Pre-process the dataset**:
    - Clean and pre-process the dataset to ensure data quality.
    
2. **Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)**:
    - Develop an LSI model to retrieve similar reviews.
    - Tune the model and present results with observations.

3. **Neural information retrieval**:
    - Develop a neural information retrieval model.
    - Compare its performance with the best-tuned LSI model.
    - Develop an interactive interface for user interaction.

4. **Clustering and analysis**:
    - Extend the retrieval system to include clustering of search results.
    - Determine optimal clusters dynamically and evaluate model performance.
    - Develop an interactive interface for users.

5. **Summarize topics within clusters**:
    - Summarize results from each cluster using abstractive and extractive methods.
    - Evaluate summarization algorithms and add extra functionality.
    - Develop an interactive interface for summarization.
